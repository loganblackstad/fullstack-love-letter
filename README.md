<p align="center"><em>A Game of Risk, Deduction, and Luck.</em></p>

<p>Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 4-6 players. Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen, eighteen, or twenty cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!

## Features

- **Clean, intuitive design** — With Blog & Comment, all blog posts are displayed on a centered page with optimal use of whitespace for readability. Inspired by [Medium's](https://medum.com/), Blog & Comment is responsive, so it looks great on tablets, phones, and even in print.

- **Everything on a single page** — Gone are the days when your users had to paginate through a million pages to find fresh content. Blog & Comment puts all content on a single page. We haven't sacrificed linkability, though. As you scroll, your browser's hash will update to the nearest header, so linking to a particular point in the documentation is still natural and easy.

- **Secure Login** — Lorem Ipsum
